## What is this project?

Mitchell (name is going to change never got to that point) is a webapp that will allow users to log all of their fitness and food throughout a day, allowing you view the data and compare over several weeks to live your best and healthiest life

This repository will include the two working pages (index and fitness) and the other two(food and journal) are in the beginning stages of layout so far

## Designing

The first steps I made in designing this webapp was to start by researching other applications/websites in competetiton. Once I had a concept of the features I wanted my app to include I set out using Figma to start wireframing the project. After the wireframes were completed I then started doing the screendesigns for both Desktop and Mobile devices, after that I began working on the css and html to implement a running version
