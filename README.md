## What is this project?

Mitchell (name is going to change never got to that point) is a webapp that will allow users to log all of their fitness and food throughout a day, allowing you view the data and compare over several weeks to live your best and healthiest life

This repository will include the two working pages (index and fitness) and the other two(food and journal) are in the beginning stages of layout so far

## Designing

The first steps I made in designing this webapp was to start by researching other applications/websites in competetiton. Once I had a concept of the features I wanted my app to include I set out using Figma to start wireframing the project. After the wireframes were completed I then started doing the screendesigns for both Desktop and Mobile devices, after that I began working on the css and html to implement a running version

This was my inital idea for a sitemap I had based on research, alot of applications only focus on one topic (food, fitness, journaling etc.) I wanted to be able to combine them all into one format. This was my first time working as a designer and all the processes and tools used were very new and proved to be extremely challenging throughout the experiments

# WireFrame

Since this was my first time wireframing it was a very new concept to me and found myself getting frustrated easily and becoming very overwhelmed with the process as I was never 100% sure what was needed to continue forward. All the design process will be found in the attached figma file link above as well as in the self submission for the assessment

This was my first wireframes for the dashboard and the fitness page. I started using a figma toolkit for frameworking to get a general idea of how I wanted each piece to look, the wireframing kit made it more complicated and restrictive so I moved to just creating the assets by myself and it made wireframing alot less stressful and gave me more freedom to create.

Here is what I ended up with alot cleaner and easier to read/understand

# ScreenDesign

Again used Figma for the screen designs. I was unsure of where to start off so I spoke to a few ID students from code to ask them about their process and how they begin designing their projects. I learned to make as subtle moves as possible when designing so if I ever make a mistake/dislike the changes the previous version will not set me way back to the beginning. It was also suggested to ignore the grids that figma allows you to place and add the grids hand drawn where I think they best fit after I had finished the screen designs. I ended up designing 4 pages for the web app which Im very happy with the results, I created a mobile layout for the two screens I implemented into html and css, however the screen designs became too ambitious for my implementation skills and the scrolling sections had to be changed as well as the navigation bar for the time being. The designs were quite scalable I believe so I decided an extra tablet design wouldn't be needed

# HTML/CSS

For the responsive site I picked the two screens I was happiest with and implemented them with CSS and HTML

The implementation proved many problems for me as it turns out the screens were a bit more intensive to implement that I had previous believed so I stuck to just working on my two favourites.

I have previous experience with HTML and CSS but not with responsive design so the breaking points were all very new to me as well as the constant experimentation for how make all the content fit onto multiple devices. Using grids was very new to me and proved to be frustrating skill but again felt it was a valuable skill to learn and will make future frontends easy to build. It waws a very small scale project so I was lucky that nothing too complicated was needed but in the end was happy that I was able to work out even a dumbed down version to have the learning process

# Reflection

As said many times I was very new to all of this from a design perspective. It became very frustrating but rewarding I feel like I learned an incredible amount from wireframing up until using css grids for a better format of a website. I know that with more time I will have something better but for right now and for this module I am happy to submit this for a level 1. I feel the time spent and the product at the end speaks for itself. The learning journy was steep and hard but worth it in the end
